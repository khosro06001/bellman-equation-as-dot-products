# Bellman Expectation Equation — Vector Form Cheat Sheet

A compact 2-page summary of the Bellman Expectation Equation 
expressed as vector dot products.

## What's novel
The standard presentations use either scalar summation notation 
(hard to see structure) or full matrix form (abstract). This 
reformulation expresses the Bellman equation as four explicit 
dot products, making the computational structure immediately 
visible to anyone familiar with linear algebra.
